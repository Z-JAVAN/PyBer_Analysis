# PyBer_Analysis
we will exploratory analysis and visualization using ride sharing data to help improve access to ride sharing services and determine cost-effectiveness .
##Resources
Software: Python 3.7.6, JupyterLab 2.26<br/>

###Overview
The PyBer Summary DataFrame provides an overview comparison of PyBer's ridesharing services in three types of cities: rural, surburban, and urban cities.Between January 2019 and May 2019, there were 1,625 rides in urban cities, 625 rides in suburban cities, and 125 rides in rural cities.  The summary demonstrates that there is a larger demand for PyBer among riders in urban cities compared to suburban and rural cities.

###Results


Suburban cities' average fare per driver is about $40.The average fare per driver is about $55 in rural cities, whereas the average fare per driver is about $17 in urban cities. In terms of costs, it appears that riders in rural cities pay on average almost $10 more for PyBer than riders in urban cities.
